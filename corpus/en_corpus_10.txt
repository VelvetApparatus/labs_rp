The speech synthesis system should sound natural and intelligible.
The model’s performance is important when operating in real time.
Neural network methods make it possible to convey complex intonation and emotions.
Today we are comparing several modern speech synthesis models.
The higher the quality of the data, the better the model’s training results.
Some models use transformers, while others rely on diffusion processes.
In this laboratory work, we analyze the trade-off between quality and speed.
Speech synthesis is widely used in voice assistants and audiobooks.
Multilingual models allow working with several languages at once.
The quality of synthesis can be evaluated both subjectively and using formal metrics.
